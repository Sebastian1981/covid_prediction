### **App Usage:**
**- Step 1:** in the menue dropdown menue (top left) select "Predict ICU Patients"; on the next page press the "Update COVID-Data" button to download live data from ourworldindata.org\
**- Step 2:** Missing data is always present; set the maximal percentage of missing rows in each dataset of each country; if the percentage is increased, more countries will be available for prediction; however, this comes at the cost of more countries with messy data and therefore less accurate predictions for those countries\
**- Step 3:** Select a country of interest; a plot of each time series is depicted, at this step, it is important to check the quality of each time series; in case the quality is bad, the predictions will be poor\
**- Step 4:** Define the forecasting horizont in days; obviously, the longer the forecast, the less accurate\
**- Step 5:** Define the training period; this is a very crucial step in machine learning; in general, increasing the amount of data for model training the better in most cases (not all...depending on many issues); the forecast will be a running forecast from the day of the end of training until the present day (i.e. the the of the data download minus the number of days to predict)\
**- Step 6:** press the "train model" button to train the model; a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, a so-called Light-GBM (=Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is then trained in the background. Light-GBM is a free, open-source distributed gradient enhancement machine learning framework originally developed by Microsoft. Technically, Light-GBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithm. Light-GBM was used here because it is highly accurate and fast compared to most other ml-algorithms.\
**- Step 7:** have a look at the comparison between the actual ICU patients curve and the forecast; please note that both curve should correlate but not match each other; the reason being is that the actual icu patients curve shoulf follow the forecast; try out multiple countries and you will see that in numerours cases it is possible to predict the number of ICU patients with good accuracy for a couply of weeks into the testing period\
**- Step 8:** if you are interested in the features potentially driving icu patients in the nearby future, the press the "feature importance" button; note that correlation is not causation!\
**- Step 9:** enjoy playing with the app!
